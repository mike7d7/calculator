## About

calculator2 is an Android GUI for the incredible calculator
[libqalculate](https://github.com/Qalculate/libqalculate).

## Features

Most features from libqalculate are implemented with the exception of:
 - Currency (WIP).
 - Entry completion and hints.
 - Calculate-as-you-type mode.
 - Calculation history.
 - Create/edit functions, variables and units.
 - Plotting.

All non-implemented features **may** be implemented in the future.

## Status

This project is perfectly usable as a daily driver: all functions, units
(except currencies), and variables work as expected.
